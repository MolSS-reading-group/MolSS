The Machine Learning for Simulations Reading Group specializes in the intersection of machine learning and computational biology, emphasizing the following key areas:

Sampling Methods: We critically examine advanced sampling algorithms, primarily Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, exploring their theoretical foundations and computational efficiency.

Neural Samplers: Our discussions encompass cutting-edge neural sampling approaches, particularly Boltzmann generators, analyzing their architecture, training procedures, and potential to enhance sampling in complex molecular spaces.

Applications to Molecular Problems: We focus intensively on how these sophisticated machine learning techniques can revolutionize molecular dynamics simulations, molecular structure prediction, and novel molecule generation.
