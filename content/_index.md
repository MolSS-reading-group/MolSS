### About *MolSS*
Welcome ðŸ‘‹ MolSS is a weekly-based reading group, which focus on probabilistic machine learning for a wide range of applications related to molecules. We invite researchers working on the related topics to present their works as well as their inspiring insights.

MolSS runs each session in a **tutorial**-like fashion, where speaker will ideally introduce topics they are expertised and interested in for 20-30 miniutes followed by a discussion session for 20-30 minutes. 

### Our Scopes
  - [Sampling Methods and Neural Samplers](/Scopes/SamplingMethod/)
  - [Molecular Dynamics](/Scopes/MD/)
  - [Molecule Generation](/Scopes/MG/)
