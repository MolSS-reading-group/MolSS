### About *MolSS*
Welcome ðŸ‘‹
MolSS is a biweekly reading group that focuses on probabilistic machine learning across a wide range of applications related to molecules. We invite researchers working on related topics to present their work and share their inspiring insights.

Each MolSS session is run in a **tutorial-like** format, where the speaker ideally introduces topics they are experienced in and passionate about for 20â€“30 minutes, followed by a discussion session lasting another 20â€“30 minutes.

<!-- ### Our Scopes
  - [Sampling Methods and Neural Samplers]({{< relref "Scopes/SamplingMethod/_index.md" >}})
  - [Molecular Dynamics](./Scopes/MD/)
  - Machine Learning Force Field
  - [Molecule Generation](./Scopes/MG/) -->
