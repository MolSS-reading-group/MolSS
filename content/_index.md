### About *MolSS*
Welcome ðŸ‘‹
MolSS is a biweekly reading group that focuses on probabilistic machine learning across a wide range of applications related to molecules. We invite researchers working on related topics to present their work and share their inspiring insights.

Each MolSS session is **one hour** long, consisting of a 30â€“50 minute presentation followed by a 10â€“30 minute discussion and Q&A. We especially welcome *tutorial-style* talks in which the speaker shares topics they know deeply and are passionate about.

<!-- ### Our Scopes
  - [Sampling Methods and Neural Samplers]({{< relref "Scopes/SamplingMethod/_index.md" >}})
  - [Molecular Dynamics](./Scopes/MD/)
  - Machine Learning Force Field
  - [Molecule Generation](./Scopes/MG/) -->
